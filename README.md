LIRI - Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface


LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI uses the command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data from Spotify, BandsInTown and OMDB API's.
